        <h1>About programming</h1>
        <p>Programming is all about <em>writing code</em>.
            Code can be simply defined as a set of instructions that a computer can understand.</p>
        <p>But computers cannot <strong>understand</strong> code in itself, because it speaks
        only binary! So, we need a <em>translator</em>; in this case, the translator is called a
        <strong>compiler</strong>.</p>
        <p>Some programming languages are not compiled to binary code. Instead, they are <em> interpreted</em>,
        This means that the translator, i.e., <strong>interpreter</strong>, translates the code to 
        machine instructions in real time. This can be a bit slow, but it has some advantages.</p>
        <p>Here are some <em>compiled</em> programming languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C;</li>
            <li>C++;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some <em>interpreted</em> programming languages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python;</li>
            <li>JavaScript;</li>
        </ol>
